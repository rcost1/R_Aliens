# R_Aliens
A R Studio project that takes in a large csv from kaggle on alien sightings. Using ggplot2, plottly, and of course R, I took in a large csv and created graphs with it. 
These graphs were a result of cleaning, manipulating, and transforming data and loading them into data frames.

Using ioslides, I created a full presentation and explanation of the data.
